# FullStack_FrontEnd_App
This is the front end development of a website that documents the departments at its respective employees in a company. 
This Code is written by following a tutorial made by the Youtube channel "Art of Engineer" 
and the video is called "React JS + .NET Core Web API + Microsoft SQL | full stack app tutorial" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON-Z1iD6Y-c).

The tutorial writes the code using react and implements class components but since i want to code using functional components, this code will be different 
from what the tutorial has shown. 

This project is written using Visual Studio Code as IDE. 

There is also a backend repositroy for this project called FullStack_BackEnd_App where we have written a .Net Core Web API application

Also there is a bug where the filtering of IDs are not working properly. You have to type in the id and then remove it using backspace to make the filtering work.
